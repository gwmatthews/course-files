## Opener 

- What would you do if cell phones suddenly disappeared? 
- Would you be happier, healthier, more anxious, lonelier, more productive?
- Ask students to write down three positive and three negative things that would result. Randomly pick three people to respond with one point each.

*5 minutes*

## Question everything?

- Socrates: the first philosopher.
- His mission: to find out and critically evaluate the assumptions that his fellow citizens made about how best to live.
- His method: challenging others to examine their assumptions. Often resulting in skeptical conclusions:  the only thing he knew was how little he knew.
- His fate: eventually he pissed off enough people that they killed him for corrupting the youth.

## What do we know and how do we know it?

Skepticism: a general attitude of questioning things instead of taking them for granted as true. What are its uses and limits?

Example: have cell phones destroyed a generation?

Skimming task.

- Read through cell phone article to find out:
  - Three effects that author claims cell phone use has had on the youngest generation.
  - What are the cut off dates of this generation?
  - What sources of evidence does the author use to base her conclusions on?
  
- How might we go about evaluating claims like this for scientific adequacy?

We need to answer two questions:

- Does the evidence support the claims made?
- Is the evidence itself reliable?

*20 minutes*

## What is science anyway?

Science as organized skepticism.

Constraints on skepticism:

- Rejection of global skepticism
- Many eyes make all bugs shallow
- Hypothetico-deductive method
  - make claims explicit and testable
  - test them
  - put forward theories last
  - theories subject to revision based on new data, new theories, new ideas
  - aims towards integration of knowledge
- Naturalistic explanations only.
  
*10 minutes*

## Philosophical questions about science

Brainstorming activity: come up with 2 of each kind of philosophical question

Questions should be:

- general
- about basic assumptions
- not the kind of questions that science answers 
- the sort of questions inquisitive kids ask

*Metaphysical questions:* questions about reality, what exists, its basic nature and behavior

*Epistemological questions:* questions about knowledge, its possibility, its forms and their limitations

*Axiological questions:* questions of value, what matters, right and wrong, good and evil, justice, fairness, beauty

*15 minutes*


## Conclusions

Why doesn't skepticism have to entail relativism?
