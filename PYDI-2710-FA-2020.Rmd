## *Special Note*

<div class="caution" markdown="1">

Given the unusual circumstances in which we all find ourselves, I want to make sure everyone knows that I will do my utmost to help you get the most of this course.

This includes doing my best to make this course accessible, engaging and well organized no matter HOW it ends up being offered -- in the classroom, remotely or as a fully online course.

It also includes helping you to meet your own basic needs for health, safety, housing, food and social engagement. Some of these things are beyond my personal ability to solve (I don't happen to have dozens of spare rooms or a farm at my disposal). But at least I may have some ideas on how to meet these needs when things get difficult. So please do not hesitate to reach out if you need to! 

</div>

## *Textbook*

<div class="note" markdown="1">

There is no textbook for this course. Required readings and other assignments are available at the [Science or Superstition course blog](http://www.6worlds.net/science-blog/). We will be making extensive use of the blog in this course so please check it out and bookmark it now. In the beginning of the course there will be a workshop on how to use the blog.

</div>

## *Groups*

<div class="groups" markdown="1">

Everyone in class has randomly assigned to a group of 4 or 5 people. These groups are for four different purposes:

1. They will determine when you should plan on attending class. The new safety requirements limit the number of people who can be in the classroom at one time. What this means is that half of you will be assigned to attend in person on Tuesdays and the other half on Thursdays, with the other day involving attending via the remote Zoom link.
2. They determine when your blog posts are due. Your blog posts are done by you alone, group membership just determines *when* you post.
3. You will work with your group on in-class assignments such as the Case Studies.

</div>

## *Assignments*

### Participation

- To encourage active participation in a situation that might seem to lead us all to disconnect, showing up in the classroom as well as active participation when showing up for the remote classroom will be a part of your grade. 

- Everyone will get 1 point for every time they show up in class, or show up and ACTIVELY participate remotely, through chat, video or voice.
