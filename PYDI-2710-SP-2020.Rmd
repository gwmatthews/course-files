### *Textbook*

Readings are available at the [Science or Superstition course blog](http://www.6worlds.net/science-blog/).

***

### *Groups*

Everyone in class will be randomly assigned to a group of 3 or 4 people. These groups are for three different purposes:

1. They determine when your blog posts are due. Your blog posts are done by you alone, group membership just determines when you post.
2. You will work with your group on in-class assignments such as the Case Studies.
3. You will work with your group on the big group project described below.

***

### *Assignments*

#### Blog

- Everyone in the course will be required to post three original articles to the course blog. Posting deadlines will be determined by which group you are in. See [course calendar](http://www.6worlds.net/science-blog/science-or-superstition/assignments/) for details.

#### Blog comments

- In addition to posting articles on the blog you will also be required to comment on your classmates articles 20 times over the course of the semester.

#### Reading comments

- The course blog also contains the readings for the semester. In addition to commenting on your classmates posts, you will also have to comment 20 times on items from the reading list.

#### Case studies

- There will be five in-class case study assignments to be completed with your group.

#### Group project

- The big group project for the semester is an extended examination in some area of "not quite science." This project will involve: establishing a group charter, keeping notes on group meetings and progress, picking a topic, investigating that topic, writing a group blog post, and doing a brief class presentation on the final exam day. We will get started on this project in class.

### *Class norms*

Cell phones and laptops are useful tools but they can also be a distraction. It is expected that showing up to class means you are intending to fully participate. This means that if devices are open you shouldn't be doing non-class related things on them including working on blog posts and comments during class.

Participating in class discussions is a great way to learn as much as you can from the course so being willing to participate and not leave it up to the unofficial "spokespeople" who may step up to respond to questions is encouraged.


### *Attendance*

Class attendance is expected, especially on days when in-class activities such as case studies are scheduled. As an incentive for attending, perfect attendance (missing no classes all semester) earns 5 points extra credit, missing 1 class earns 4 points, 2 classes 3 points.
