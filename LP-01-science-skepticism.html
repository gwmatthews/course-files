<div id="aims" class="section level2">
<h2>Aims</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Understand who Socrates was and why he thought his mission was important.</li>
<li>Recognize the role of skepticism in science and philosophy.</li>
<li>Become famliar with the three main branches of philosophy and with representative questions in each.</li>
<li>Distinguish between two different ways in which a scientific claim can fail</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="opener" class="section level2">
<h2>Opener</h2>
<ul>
<li>What would you do if cell phones suddenly disappeared?</li>
<li>Would you be happier, healthier, more anxious, lonelier, more productive?</li>
<li>Ask students to write down three positive and three negative things that would result. Randomly pick three people to respond with one point each.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>5 minutes</em></p>
</div>
<div id="question-everything" class="section level2">
<h2>Question everything?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Socrates: the first philosopher.</li>
<li>His mission: to find out and critically evaluate the assumptions that his fellow citizens made about how best to live.</li>
<li>His method: challenging others to examine their assumptions. Often resulting in skeptical conclusions: the only thing he knew was how little he knew.</li>
<li>His fate: eventually he pissed off enough people that they killed him for corrupting the youth.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>15 minutes</em></p>
</div>
<div id="what-do-we-know-and-how-do-we-know-it" class="section level2">
<h2>What do we know and how do we know it?</h2>
<p>Skepticism: a general attitude of questioning things instead of taking them for granted as true. What are its uses and limits?</p>
<p>Example: have cell phones destroyed a generation?</p>
<p>Skimming task.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read through cell phone article to find out:
<ul>
<li>Three effects that author claims cell phone use has had on the youngest generation.</li>
<li>What are the cut off dates of this generation?</li>
<li>What sources of evidence does the author use to base her conclusions on?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How might we go about evaluating claims like this for scientific adequacy?</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to answer two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the evidence support the claims made?</li>
<li>Is the evidence itself reliable?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>20 minutes</em></p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-science-anyway" class="section level2">
<h2>What is science anyway?</h2>
<p>Science as organized skepticism.</p>
<p>Constraints on skepticism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rejection of global skepticism</li>
<li>Many eyes make all bugs shallow</li>
<li>Hypothetico-deductive method
<ul>
<li>make claims explicit and testable</li>
<li>test them</li>
<li>put forward theories last</li>
<li>theories subject to revision based on new data, new theories, new ideas</li>
<li>aims towards integration of knowledge</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Naturalistic explanations only.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>10 minutes</em></p>
</div>
<div id="philosophical-questions-about-science" class="section level2">
<h2>Philosophical questions about science</h2>
<p>Brainstorming activity: come up with 2 of each kind of philosophical question</p>
<p>Questions should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>general</li>
<li>about basic assumptions</li>
<li>not the kind of questions that science answers</li>
<li>the sort of questions inquisitive kids ask</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Metaphysical questions:</em> questions about reality, what exists, its basic nature and behavior</p>
<p><em>Epistemological questions:</em> questions about knowledge, its possibility, its forms and their limitations</p>
<p><em>Axiological questions:</em> questions of value, what matters, right and wrong, good and evil, justice, fairness, beauty</p>
<p><em>15 minutes</em></p>
</div>
<div id="conclusions" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Question to think about: Why doesnâ€™t embracing skepticism have to lead to embracing relativism and giving up on truth?</p>
</div>
